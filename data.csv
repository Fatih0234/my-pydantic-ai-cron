This suggests that changes in EV charger growth are not strongly related to the prices of this metals ETF. Investors should consider other factors when analyzing metals ETFs in relation to EV trends.2025-03-25T19:50:43.344310+00:00,PPLT,0.270899,"The current positive correlation of 0.27 indicates a weak relationship between EV charging growth and PPLT prices.
